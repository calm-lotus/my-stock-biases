# MY BIAS/CLAIM
**1. The Psychological Hack ("Out of Sight, Out of Mind")**

Create a separate account for your long-term holdings that you do not look at every day. Seeing "red" (losses) triggers physical stress and the emotional urge to "fix it," which usually leads to the destructive habit of panic selling at the bottom.

**2. The 5-Year Reality Check**

Zoom out. Despite short-term pain, high-quality stocks generally trend up over a 5-year period because:

-   **Big Money Support:**  Billionaires, hedge funds, and ETFs are constantly buying and rebalancing.
    
-   **Corporate Action:**  Companies buy back their own shares (reducing supply).
    
-   **Inflation:**  As currency weakens over time, asset prices (stocks) naturally rise to compensate.

# GEMINI's VALIDATION

This claim is  **"Mostly True" for the overall market (Indices)**  but  **"Dangerous" for individual stocks.**

The advice to "separate your accounts" and "not look every day" is psychologically sound, but the claim that  _"all these stocks go up eventually"_  is a statistical myth that can lead to significant losses if applied to the wrong assets.

Here is the validation of the specific points:

### 1. "Look at 5Y long term trend, all these stocks go up eventually"

**Verdict: FALSE (for individual stocks)**

While the  **S&P 500 Index**  has historically been positive in roughly  **88%**  of 5-year rolling periods, individual stocks often fail to recover.

-   **The "Survivorship Bias" Trap:**  We tend to remember the winners (Apple, Microsoft) and forget the giants that didn't come back in 5 years.
    
-   **Real-World Examples:**
    
    -   **Intel (INTC):**  Down ~50-60% over the last 5 years.
        
    -   **PayPal (PYPL):**  Down ~75% from its highs 5 years ago.
        
    -   **Cisco (CSCO):**  Still hasn't recovered its year 2000 highs (26 years later).
        
-   **Takeaway:**  If you hold an  _Index ETF_  (like SPY or VOO), the "it always comes back" rule works. If you hold  _individual stocks_, they can go to zero.
    

### 2. "Billionaires / Hedge Funds buy them"

**Verdict: PARTIALLY TRUE**

-   **The Reality:**  Institutional investors (Smart Money) provide a "floor" for high-quality stocks, but they are not loyal. They will ruthlessly sell a stock if the thesis changes.
    
-   **The Trap:**  Retail investors often see a billionaire buy a stock and assume it's safe. However, billionaires often use  **hedges**  (options) that protect them if the stock drops, which you might not have.
    

### 3. "ETFs rebalance"

**Verdict: TRUE**

-   This is a powerful force. Most major ETFs are "Market Cap Weighted."
    
-   **How it helps winners:**  As a stock goes up (like NVIDIA), ETFs are mathematically forced to buy  _more_  of it, creating a snowball effect.
    
-   **How it hurts losers:**  As a stock drops (like Intel), ETFs are forced to  _sell_  it to lower its weight, which suppresses the price further.
    

### 4. "Share repurchase and currency weakens"

**Verdict: VERY TRUE**

-   **Share Repurchases (Buybacks):**  This is the #1 engine of the modern stock market. Companies like Apple and Meta spend billions buying their own shares, which reduces the supply. Lower supply = Higher Price (even if the company doesn't grow much).
    
-   **Currency Weakness:**  Stocks are "real assets." If the dollar loses 3% of its value (inflation), stocks usually rise 3% just to stay even. Over 10-20 years, a huge portion of stock gains is just the currency getting weaker.
    

### Summary

The advice you received is  **excellent for an ETF investor**  but  **risky for a stock picker**.

**If you own...**

**"Don't look at it" Strategy**

**S&P 500 / Total Market ETF**

**Genius.**  (Volatility is noise; the trend is math).

**High Quality Big Tech (Mag 7)**

**Good.**  (Dominant moats usually recover).

**Speculative / Growth Stocks**

**Dangerous.**  (You need to cut losses if the business breaks).

This video is relevant because it reinforces the "long-term mindset" mentioned in your text, explaining the mathematics of how market volatility (the "red" you hate seeing) actually benefits long-term holders through dollar-cost averaging and recovery cycles.
